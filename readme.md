# React Native Boilerplate


## What is this?

This is a boilerplate for React Native projects. It includes a few things that I find myself using in every project, so I decided to make a boilerplate to save time.

## What's included?

- [React Native Router Flux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-router-flux)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
- [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)

## What's you get out of the box?

- A basic navigation setup with a few screens
- A basic Redux setup with a few actions and reducers
- A basic Redux Persist setup
- A basic React Native Vector Icons setup
- I18n setup with a few languages
- Common components, like a button, a text input, a text, etc.
- A basic theme setup
- Utils folder with a few useful functions, like validation, etc.
